	Variation 4
	<br>
	<br>
	When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer
	<br>
	When I heard the learn’d astronomer, &nbsp;  When the proofs, &nbsp; the figures, &nbsp; were ranged in columns before me,  &nbsp; When I was shown the charts and diagrams, &nbsp; to add, &nbsp; divide, &nbsp; and measure them,  &nbsp;When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room, &nbsp;How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, &nbsp; Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,  &nbsp; In the mystical moist night-air, &nbsp; and from time to time, &nbsp; Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.
	<br>
	- Walt Whitman
