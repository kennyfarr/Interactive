			“Art appears when what is made feels as if there is a profound misunderstanding at the heart of what it is, as if it were made with the wrong use in mind, or the wrong idea about what it is capable of, or simply the wrong set of assumptions about what it means to fully function in the world. A work works by not working at all. By not obeying the law of any system or authority external to the process of its own making, a work emphatically expresses its own right to exist for itself and in itself, and questions — by merely existing — the rule of law that works to bind all to semblance of the common good. Art is a lawless proposition.” Do you agree with Chan’s definition of art? Do you think this can be extended to design as well?

			I think Chan's Definiton of art is somewhat correct in saying that a work can express its own right to exist for and in itself, but I do not think that all art necessarily arises from "profound" misunderstandings. In most cases, I think that works of art, especially modern art, comes to life in a different way than the artist imagined, and can be interpreted in a million different ways than how the artist sees thier art, but the difference in interpretation doesn't have to come from a misunderstanding, only a different point of view. One work of art can have many different meanings in a public space, and each meaning in its own way can be true, because artwork cannot be seen as black or white, but a combination of different things.

			In terms of design, I think that a similar mindset can also be applied, but usually there is more context in design to give meaning to the works. But I do think that design works can also be imterpreted in many ways as well, just as many ways as it can be interpreted.
